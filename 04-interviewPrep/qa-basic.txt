1.) What is SQL?
It is used a language to interact for information from a relational databases.

2.) What are different types of SQL commands?
They are classifed based on the type of action they perform
a.) DDL -> Data Definition Language -> CREATE, ALTER,DROP and TRUNCATE
b.) DML -> Data Manipulation Language ->  INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
c.) DQL -> Data Query Language -> Select
d.) DCL -> Data Control Language -> GRANT and REVOKE
e.) TCL -> Transmission Control Language -> COMMIT ,CONTROL and ROLLBACK

3.) Main difference between Database, RDBMS and DBMS?
Database: Organised collection of data
DBMS: Software to manage databases.
RDBMS: A DBMS that is used to manage the relational data stored in structured format in rows and columns
eg: MySQL,postgreSQl and SQL server

4.) Primary Key
Column or set of columns that uniquely define a record in the database. They cannot be null or duplicates

5.) Foriegn Key
It is a field from one table that is referenced in another table.
This is used to prepare relationship betweem 2 tables in a database

6.) Unique Key
It is used to define a key using the UNIQUE constraint. This gurantees that every value in the column remains distinct.

7.) What is NULL in the context of database
It represents missing or absence of value (Unknown data).

8.) difference between VARCHAR and CHAR?
VARCHAR(N) -> used to store a collection of characters with variable length
char(n) -> used to store a fixed length of characters. Rest of space is padded with empty character

9.) Data Types in SQL
Numeric → INT, DECIMAL, FLOAT
String → CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT
Date/Time → DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP
Binary → BLOB

10.) difference between Primary key and Unique key?
Primary key -> One per table, connot be null
Unique key -> Multiple allowed, Null is a permitted value

11.) Default and Check constaints?
DEFAULT: Assigns a default value if none is provided.
CHECK: Ensures values meet a condition.

12.) Schema
A schema is a logical container for database objects such as tables, views, and procedures

13.) Candidate key:
One more or keys are used to define Unique identity rows

14.) Composite key:
A key formed by combining two or more columns to uniquely identify a row.

15.) Difference between Super key, Candidate key and Primary key
Super Key: Any column set that uniquely identifies rows.
Candidate Key: Minimal super key (no redundant attributes).
Primary Key: Chosen candidate key used for row identification.

16.) Cartesian join
Also called a cross join, it returns the Cartesian product of two tables.


17.) Difference between SQL, MySQL and SQL server
SQL: The language for managing relational data.
MySQL: An open-source RDBMS using SQL.
SQL Server: Microsoft’s RDBMS product.

18.) Difference between SQL and NoSQL
SQL:Relational, structured, ACID-compliant.
NoSQL: Non-relational, schema-free, designed for scalability.

18.) Advantages of SQL
Standardized language
Portable across databases
Supports complex queries and joins
Ensures data integrity


19.) Main applications of sql
Using SQL, we can:

create, delete, and update tables in a database
access, manipulate, and modify data in a table
retrieve and summarize the necessary information from a table or several tables
add or remove certain rows or columns from a table

20.) JOINS:
Combines one or more tables through a relationship.

(INNER) JOIN – returns only those records that satisfy a defined join condition in both (or all) tables. It's a default SQL join.

LEFT (OUTER) JOIN – returns all records from the left table and those records from the right table that satisfy a defined join condition.

RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN – returns all records from the right table and those records from the left table that satisfy a defined join condition.

FULL (OUTER) JOIN – returns all records from both (or all) tables. It can be considered as a combination of left and right joins.

Note:
FULL OUTER JOIN is supported by PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and MySQL 8.0 and above, but MySQL only allows it through UNION patterns; meanwhile, SQLite does not support RIGHT JOIN, which can be emulated using LEFT JOIN in combination with UNION.


27.) Schema:
It is a collection of database tables along with table triggers.

28.) SQL operator:
a keyword used in SQL queries to perform a specific operation.

29.) Clause:
conditions imposed in a query to get a desired result.
eg: WHERE, LIMIT ,HAVING,ORDER BY, LIKE , NOT LIKE

30.) Create a table:
A new table in a database can be created by using the "create table" syntax.

31.) Update a table:
The data in a table can be update by using the set keyword along woith restriction to update only a certain row or group of rows.

32.) Delete a table:
A table can be deleted by using the drop table cmd.

33.) Sort a table -> using the ORDER BY

34.) How to select all columns  in a table - > using the * after rhe select command

35.) How to select common records from 2 tables -> 
SELECT col1, col2 FROM table_1
INTERSECT
SELECT col1, col2 FROM table_2;

36.)Distinct:
It is used to find distinct values from a column.
