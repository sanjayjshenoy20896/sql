What is table and field
Table -> it is a set of rows and columns
field -> It is a column representing an attribute

What is a select command
It is used to retrive data from database

What are sql constraints
They are rules that are applied to maintain data consistancy
PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, NOT NULL,AUTO INCREMENTING

Normalisdation:
organizing data to reduce redundancy, improve integrity, and make it more efficient, often by structuring it into related tables

Indexes:
Indexes speed up lookups. Types include clustered, non-clustered, composite, unique, and covering indexes.
used for storing its important parts and enabling faster data search and retrieval.

Group by:
It is used group rows by same values with aggregates

Aggregate functions
SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()

Alias:
It is used to remporarily name a column in a database

View:
It is a saved instance of a query in a virtual table

Difference between IN and between
BETWEEN: Checks if value is within a range.
IN: Checks if value is among specified list.

Difference between IN and exists
IN: Compares a value against a list or subquery.
EXISTS: Checks if subquery returns any rows.

Difference between ANY and all
ANY: True if condition holds for at least one value.
ALL: True if condition holds for all values.

Temporary table:
A table created for intermediate storage, often session-specific.

Subquery:
It is a query listed another query.

Trigger:
Code that runs automatically when they is an INSERT,UPDATE AND DELETE events

Stored procedures:
precompilied list of sql commands stored in a database

Function:
A reusable program that returns a value or a record.

Difference betweem UNION and UNION ALL
UNION: Combines results, removes duplicates.
UNION ALL: Combines results, keeps duplicates.

Difference between RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER()
RANK(): Skips ranks for ties
DENSE_RANK(): No gaps in ranking
ROW_NUMBER(): Assigns unique numbers

ACID Properties:
A -> ATOMICITY -> Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit; either all of its operations are completed successfully
C -> CONSISTANCY -> Guarantees that a transaction only brings the database from one valid state to another, adhering to all predefined rules and constraints
I -> Isolation -> Ensures that multiple transactions can run concurrently without interfering with each other
D -> Durability -> Guarantees that once a transaction has been successfully committed, its changes are permanent and will not be lost, even in the event of system crashes, power failures, or other abnormal terminations
