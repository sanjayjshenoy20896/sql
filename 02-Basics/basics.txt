Data types in mysql

INT -> Whole numbers
DECIMAL(M,N) -> Decimal numbers
VARCHAR(N) -> String of length N 
BLOB -> Binary Large Object
Date -> YYYY-MM-DD
TIMESTAMP -> 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'

Creating a new table for our database
The table can be created by using the "create table"

syntax: create table <table_name>{
    //individual field in each line
}

eg: 
create table student (
	student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(20)
);

or 

create table student (
	student_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(20),
    PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);

Describe a table:
This is used to actually describe the table with all the field and settings
Syntax: describe <table_name>;
eg: describe student;

Modify a table:
This is used to modify a table using ALTER keyword
syntax:ALTER TABLE table_name ADD/DROP <field> <data_type>
eg:
ALTER TABLE student ADD gpa DECIMAL(3,2);
ALTER TABLE student DROP gpa;

Delete a table:
This is used to actually delete a tavle with all the fields and settings:
syntax:drop table table_name
eg: drop table student;


Insert data into a table:
insert into student values (1,'Jack','Biology');
insert into student(name,major) values ('Jack','Biology');


Update a record -> it is done by using the update keyword
update student set name = 'Tom', major = 'undecided' WHERE student_id = 1;


Delete a record
delete from student WHERE name = 'Tom' and major='undecided'

Constraints:
NOT NULL -> value cannot be null. it has to be assigned a value
UNIQUE -> Ensure that all values in the column are distinct and not overlapping.
PRIMARY KEY -> Uniquely identifies a row in a table
FORIEGN KEY -> This ensures that values in the foreign key column exist in the referenced primary key column, maintaining relationships between tables.
CHECK -> Defines a condition that must be true for all values in a column
eg:a CHECK constraint can ensure that a salary value is always positive.
DEFAULT -> Specifies a default value for a column when no value is explicitly provided during an INSERT operation.
